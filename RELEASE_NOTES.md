# Release notes

User-facing changes to MangoTV, newest first. This file *is* the release
notes shown in the app's own update banner (tap the "i" info button) --
whatever sits under a version heading here becomes that release's
description, so there's no need to visit GitHub to see what changed.

(For the backend/engineering build log, see CHANGELOG.md instead -- this
file is only ever end-user-facing release notes.)

When cutting a new release: rename `## Unreleased` below to the new
version (e.g. `## 0.1.2`), add a fresh empty `## Unreleased` above it, then
run the release workflow for that version.

## Unreleased

- Trailers now open in the app of your choice (the YouTube app, a browser, whatever you have installed) instead of playing inside MangoTV, which fixes trailers playing sound over a black screen
- Movie detail pages now show the real release date when it's available, instead of just the year
- Settings is now a two-pane layout: pick a category (Account, Addons, Home Rows, Sounds, Subtitles) on the left, its settings show on the right
- Settings tabs are more compact and each one now scrolls as a whole, so long lists like Addons or Subtitle languages show more per screen
- Settings' focus highlight is now white instead of amber
- Settings > Home Rows loads faster with multiple addons installed
- Select a Source now shows results as soon as each addon responds, instead of waiting for the slowest one before showing anything
- The Home page hero now rotates through 10 random movies/TV shows from your whole catalog, picked fresh each time you launch the app, instead of always the same first row's top 10
- Fixed needing to press BACK twice to hide the player controls while the timeline was selected
- Update banner's Update button is now white instead of amber
- Fixed the Close/Open Settings buttons on the update overlays being unselectable
- Allow-installing-updates overlay's Open Settings button is now white instead of orange

## 0.1.1

- Redesigned the Genres tab: genres are now a grid of colorful cards with
  an icon per genre, instead of a plain list

## 0.1.0

- First public release
- Added in-app updates: the app now checks for new versions itself and
  lets you download and install them from a banner, without needing to
  re-sideload from scratch
- Various stability and UI fixes
