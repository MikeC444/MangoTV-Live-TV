# Release notes

User-facing changes to MangoTV, newest first. This file *is* the release
notes shown in the app's own update banner (tap the "i" info button) --
whatever sits under a version heading here becomes that release's
description, so there's no need to visit GitHub to see what changed.

(For the backend/engineering build log, see CHANGELOG.md instead -- this
file is only ever end-user-facing release notes.)

When cutting a new release: rename `## Unreleased` below to the new
version (e.g. `## 0.1.2`), add a fresh empty `## Unreleased` above it, then
run the release workflow for that version.

## Unreleased

## 0.1.1

- Redesigned the Genres tab: genres are now a grid of colorful cards with
  an icon per genre, instead of a plain list
- Fixed a scrolling stutter and a couple of sizing/legibility issues in
  the new Genres grid

## 0.1.0

- First public release
- Added in-app updates: the app now checks for new versions itself and
  lets you download and install them from a banner, without needing to
  re-sideload from scratch
- Various stability and UI fixes
